### JS

Main JS entry point: `src/js/index.js`

## JS structure explanation

```
|-- js
    |-- components
    |-- modules
    |   |-- dep
    |   |-- dev
    |-- pages
    index.js
    index.jquery.js
```

### `components`

`PublicAPI.js`, `Common.js` and other components (`Header.js` or `Footer.js` etc.).
Components from this directory should be used only by `pages` and `index`.

### `modules/dep`

Libs and modules that could not be installed via 'npm install'

### `modules/dev`

User-written modules. They shouldn't import anything (except packages from `node_modules` and other modules).

### `pages`

Scripts for each page (will be evaluated only on corresponding page).

## Public API

Path: `js/components/publicAPI` (example)

Public API is created for back-end developers.

It should contain methods to attach / initialize / destroy jquery plugins etc.

If there is no need in API, simply delete `publicAPI.js` file and it's `import`.

## Common scripts

Path: `js/components/common` (example)

Common scripts should always be executed, regardless of active 'data-page'.

If there is no need in them, simply delete `common.js` file and it's `import`.

## JSDoc

Install JSDoc globally

```
npm install jsdoc -g
```

Generate docs

```
npm run-script compileDocs
```

Open docs
```
npm run-script openDocs
```

## Notes

1. Each page should have corresponding `data-page` attribute (e.g. `<main data-page="home" />`.
2. Before pushing to Bitbucket repository (or before transferring the project to Back-end department) make sure to run `production` bundle.
3. Ensure all of your Public API's has both `init` and `destroy` methods.
4. In case of Public API or Common scripts are not-in-use - make sure to delete those files.
